00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.572
I have assembled this small circuit 
board on the breadboard. 

2
00:00:02.572 --> 00:00:06.850
We are going to discuss it later in 
detail, and now let’s just look what 
we have here. 

3
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.370
This is a resistive light sensor, which 
includes of a photo resistor and  

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.912
a regular 10 kOhm resistor. 

5
00:00:13.912 --> 00:00:17.690
Together they make up a voltage divider.  

6
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.860
It is connected to the power source of 
the microcontroller and the A0 analog 
input. 

7
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.820
Now let’s see how we can read data 
from this sensor. 

8
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.920
Let’s open the Arduino environment 
and click on the templates we had 
already seen before. 

9
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.120
We need a template from the Basics 
section here, which is called  

10
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.952
AnalogReadSerial, it’s the very first one.

11
00:00:41.952 --> 00:00:46.880
Without yet looking at it, we need to 
check if we have the right board 
connected,

12
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.101
and the right port selected. Let’s 
now download the controller. 

13
00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:56.610
Let me remind you that, if you want 
everything to work without the need 
to change the program, 

14
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.760
your sensor should be connected to 
the A0 port. 

15
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.121
Now that the sketch has been 
downloaded, 

16
00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:05.706
we need to find another thing in the 
Arduino environment – the Port 
Monitor.

17
00:01:05.706 --> 00:01:09.673
You can access it via “Tools” menu 
in the “Monitor” section 

18
00:01:09.673 --> 00:01:15.000
or the serial port or just press 
this button on the upper bar. 

19
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.620
A window has opened where we can see 
some numbers running on the screen.  

20
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.700
Let’s figure out what this is. 

21
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.389
I will now be alternating the brightness 
of the sensor by covering it with my 
hand and uncovering it again, 

22
00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:35.410
so if you look at the numbers on the 
screen, you will see them change.

23
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:43.150
within the range of 110-320. 

24
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.650
With the help of this simple experiment, 
we have found out that 

25
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.750
the brightness of the sensor is somehow 
converted into some numeric value. 

26
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.100
We are now going to see in detail 
how this works.
